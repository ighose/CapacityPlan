# Fitness Aware Container Brokering
A service that automatically deploys a chosen catalogued IT service into a best-available-fit container out of a set of available container engines hosted on various supported underlying clouds.

This only contains container deployment and benchmarking code used while developing the metric to determine best fit container.
